# CS3083_AirTrackSys
Implementation Air Ticket Reservation System as a web-based application POC
# Online Air Ticket Reservation System

## Project Overview
This project, created for the "Intro to Databases (CS-UY 3083)" course at NYU Tandon School of Engineering under Professor Ratan Dey, involves designing, implementing, and deploying an online Air Ticket Reservation System. The project covers the full database development lifecycle: conceptual design, logical design, database implementation, and the creation of an associated web-based application.

- [Insert Name & NetID of Member 3, if applicable]

## Project Parts and Deliverables

### Part 1: ER Diagram
Design an ER diagram for the online Air Ticket Reservation System based on the provided description. Ensure clarity in entity sets, attributes, relationship sets, and cardinality constraints.

**Deadline:** 03/21/2025 11:59 PM

#### ER Diagram:
Upload your ER Diagram here:

### Part 2: Relational Schema Design
Derive a relational schema from your ER diagram. Underline primary keys and use arrows to indicate foreign key constraints clearly. Write and execute SQL statements to:
- Create tables with reasonable data types.
- Insert test data (airlines, airports, customers, airplanes, staff, flights, and tickets).
- Execute and provide SQL queries and results for:
  - Future flights
  - Delayed flights
  - Customers who purchased tickets
  - Airplanes owned by Jet Blue

**Deadline:** 04/04/2025 11:59 PM

### Part 3: Web Application Development
Implement the Air Ticket Reservation System as a web-based application using your relational schema. The application must include:
- Home page functionalities (logged-in and not logged-in)
- User authentication (customer and airline staff)
- Customer use cases (view flights, search flights, purchase tickets, cancel trips, rating/commenting)
- Airline staff use cases (view flights, create flights, update status, manage airplanes/airports, view ratings, reports)

**Deadline:** 05/01/2025 11:59 PM

### Required Technical Implementation:
- Enforce complex constraints at server-side.
- Implement secure session management.
- Use prepared statements or validate inputs to prevent SQL injection.
- Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Provide user-friendly, role-specific interfaces.

### Technical Stack:
- Database: MySQL
- Backend: [Specify backend language/framework, e.g., Python/Flask]
- Frontend: [Specify frontend technology, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript]
